This is a single page application made for displaying work that I have done in
the past, and blog posts that I plan to write in the future.

Written in [[https://package.elm-lang.org][elm]], this application uses the elm architecture to manage and
update state, and to render the whole page. It also uses [[https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/][mdgriffith's elm-ui]],
which is meant to be a replacement to using css in elm applications.
